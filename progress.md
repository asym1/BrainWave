## *Primary Tasks*
  - Find conventional AI algorithms used for working with EEG data
      - note : Can we use optimizers?
  - Find new gen AI techniques that can give better results
## *Currently Working On*
- Figuring out how to clasiffy EEG data into states/labels
- Testing Neurosity SDK
## *Issues / Pending*
- (if we want to use our scripts as modules to run on a notebook, add a `__init__.py` file in the repo)
