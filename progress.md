## *Roadmap*
  - Perform EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the raw, absolute power, and psd data (with calm/focus probabilities)
  - Use decision trees / regression for Feature Importance Analysis
  - ***Phase 1***
    - Train Supervised Learning Algorithms such as Classification, Boosting, and Bagging
  - ***Phase 2***
    - Train LLM
## *Currently Working On*
- Recording and saving data
- Testing [Neurosity SDK](https://github.com/neurosity/neurosity-sdk-python?tab=readme-ov-file) 
## *Issues / Pending*
- I think the 5 second raw EEG graph in `SDKtest` is not matching the channels correctly (incorrect Y-axis)
