## What is `add_marker()`?

- A function in the Neurosity SDK that lets you insert a timestamped event into the eeg timeline. However, it does not change the eeg signal, it only records important things happening.

- **`label`** -> string describing the event 
- **`timestamp`** -> optional, milliseconds since epoch. If not provided, SDK assigns current time.

## Another example  : 

==***neurosity.add_marker({***==
    ==***"label": "eyes_closed",***==
    ==***"timestamp": int(time.time() * 1000)  # optional, defaults to "now"***==
==***})***==


-> It allows you to synchronize actions or events with EEG data.
->  Without markers, you’d have to _guess_ when the subject started focusing or relaxing.
    - Split data into segments (relax vs focus, lemon vs ball...).
    - Check if Calm/Focus probabilities align with your **ground truth markers**.
    - Validate the Neurosity model’s accuracy.



# FOR SARA & AMR TO TRY : 
Things we can try to determine if add_marker() is helpful or not: 
- Calm vs focused : Once we determine the state (calm or focused), we may add markers. Markers let you label ground truth states (when subject was actually focusing vs relaxing).
- This makes it possible to verify if Calm/Focus probabilities reflect reality.   

- Multi-trial studies    
    - Use markers like `"trial_1_start"`, `"trial_1_end"`.
    - Helps organize long sessions into labeled chunks.d
