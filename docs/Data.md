## Raw Data
Check the Brainwaves theory for an explanation of the EEG data and how to interpret it. This section will explain the different Noise & Artifacts that can show up in the raw data

## Absolute Power By Band
- Absolute power is the amount of activity within a specific frequency band of brain waves, usually ordered from slowest to fastest
## PSD Symmetry
- Power Spectral Density (PSD) is an effective method to differentiate between noise and features in a signal by showing how much power is in different frequency bands. One of the most common features extracted from EEG because brain states modulate the power of certain frequency bands (e.g. high alpha = relaxed, beta busts in motor cortex = preparing to move)
- the meaning of Symmetry in PSD symmetry is for comparing electrode pairs that are mirrored across the head
	- C3, C4 (motor cortex, left vs right)
	- CP3, CP4. CP5, CP6 (central-parietal areas, left vs right)
	- F5, F6 (frontal, left vs right)
- A ratio close to one shows symmetry, while a deviation equals lateralization, which might show that a left hand is moving for example, or if left activity is stronger in frontal then that might mean positive activity while right is linked with negative (just an example, not fact)
